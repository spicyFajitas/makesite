Welcome to my personal website hosted on Michigan Technological University's Linux Users Group Shell Server! (what a mouthful) 

My early years of education were in network engineering, Windows server environments, and virtualization, but my work experience has introduced me to DevOps technologies and spurred my interest in becoming a DevOps Engineer. Through my personal hobbies, I've taught myself containerization and I'm trying to learn more about K8s, although this is a broad and daunting task.

I started my journey in IT with three different IT Help Desk positions. I was the boots-on-the-ground person to do initial troubleshooting with any and all computer hardware and software issues. I have experiences in manufacturing and education environments.

After help desk, I joined a Cloud Team. I learned about deploying applications with a cloud-native mindset and also learned about some of the financial aspects of cloud deployments and how that impacts businesses.

Next, I decided to step into the automation space. I learned a lot about CI/CD principles and the tools that help teams achieve their goals.

I've recently graduated from Michigan Tech with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Networking and System Administration (Information Technology) and a minor in Cyber Security. I took a month or so to enjoy vacation and the odd feeling of having no commitments. After that month, I started my career as an IT Server Engineer. My primary focus at work is enterprise Linux administration and I'll be getting into OpenShift administration soon :TM:.
