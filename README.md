# Makesite

This repo assumes an architecture in which shell users each have their own home directories located at `/home/{{username}}`

Within each home directory is a `public_html` folder. The shell server servers the html contents of each user's home/{{user}}/public_html directory.

Root index.md file is located in the `content` folder.
